### Hey there! 👋

I'm Neil, a CS student passionate about building intelligent and useful applications.

I enjoy combining **AI and full-stack development** to solve real-world problems.

Most days you'll find me learning something new, building projects, or improving my skills.

My favorite tools include React, Node.js, TensorFlow, and Git.

I love turning ideas into working products and continuously pushing myself to grow.
